# Autonomous Game-Studio Progress Log

Append one entry per cycle (newest at the bottom). For the morning review: read top-to-bottom,
each entry = one verified change on branch `autonomous/game-studio`.

Format: `- [cycle N] <what changed> — tests: <pass/fail> — commit <hash>`

---

- [cycle 0] Set up autonomous framework: branch `autonomous/game-studio`, roadmap
  (`docs/GAME_STUDIO_ROADMAP.md`), this progress log. Goal: incrementally grow the autopilot into a
  capable game-studio system overnight, on a branch, with `pytest` gating every change. — setup
- [cycle 1] P0 over-creation fix: repeated-tool-call guard in the ollama/cloudflare loops
  (`orchestrator.py`) — model repeating the same tool-call set now stops instead of spinning to
  max-iterations (this is the "10 spheres" bug we hit live). Added 2 tests. — tests: 34 passed
