# Autonomous Game-Studio Progress Log

Append one entry per cycle (newest at the bottom). For the morning review: read top-to-bottom,
each entry = one verified change on branch `autonomous/game-studio`.

Format: `- [cycle N] <what changed> — tests: <pass/fail> — commit <hash>`

---

- [cycle 0] Set up autonomous framework: branch `autonomous/game-studio`, roadmap
  (`docs/GAME_STUDIO_ROADMAP.md`), this progress log. Goal: incrementally grow the autopilot into a
  capable game-studio system overnight, on a branch, with `pytest` gating every change. — setup
- [cycle 1] P0 over-creation fix: repeated-tool-call guard in the ollama/cloudflare loops
  (`orchestrator.py`) — model repeating the same tool-call set now stops instead of spinning to
  max-iterations (this is the "10 spheres" bug we hit live). Added 2 tests. — tests: 34 passed
- [cycle 2] P1 layout math: `core/layout.py` `compute_layout_positions` (grid/circle/line/scatter
  + deterministic, GPU-free jitter) — reusable building block for placement/level-building tools.
  8 tests. Next: wire a `unity_place_*` tool on top of it. — tests: 42 passed
- [cycle 3] P1 placement tool: `unity_place_primitives` — places N primitives in a chosen layout
  via the bridge, with a 500-object safety cap (also guards against scene-flooding). Builds on
  cycle 2's layout math. 3 tests. — tests: 45 passed
- [cycle 4] P1 structure math: `compute_structure_positions` (wall/tower/stairs/room/floor) —
  block-out building blocks for level design. 6 tests. Next: `unity_build_structure` tool. —
  tests: 51 passed
- [cycle 5] P1 structure tool: `unity_build_structure` — "build a wall/tower/stairs/room/floor"
  via the bridge using cycle-4 math, 500-block safety cap. 3 tests. — tests: 54 passed
- [cycle 6] P1 lighting math: `core/lighting.py` `compute_studio_lighting_rig` (3-point
  key/fill/rim) — toward presentable scenes. 4 tests. Next: `unity_setup_studio_lighting` tool. —
  tests: 58 passed
- [cycle 7] P1 lighting tool: `unity_setup_studio_lighting` — "set up studio lighting" creates a
  key/fill/rim rig via the bridge (create_light). 2 tests. — tests: 60 passed
