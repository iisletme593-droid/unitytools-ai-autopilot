"""Game QA — pure, bridge-free analysis of a blueprint plan.

Given a plan dict from `plan_game`/`plan_*_game`/`plan_ambient_decor` (its `steps`
list), count what the game is made of and judge whether it is actually playable.
No Unity, no I/O — just reads the plan the studio already produced, so the studio
can describe and sanity-check its own output before anyone builds it.
